#Leaves

Leaves is handful of classes that make it easy to present PDFs and images in a page-turning interface similar to Apple's iBooks.  Leaves uses only public APIs, sacrificing a small portion of iBooks' visual flair to ensure that Leaves-based applications are safe for submission to the App Store.

Leaves supports:
 * Text, images, PDFs -- anything that can be rendered in graphics context
 * Drag to turn the page
 * Tap to turn the page

Leaves does *not* currently support:
 * Interactive elements on the page
 * Swipe to turn the page

#Installation

Add the files in the `Leaves` directory to your XCode project.

#Notes

Leaves is still in early development. Future revisions may break the existing API.  Pull requests are welcome.
